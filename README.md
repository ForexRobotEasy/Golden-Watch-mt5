// Golden Watch MT5 - Trading Robot
// Developer: Forex Robot Easy Team
// Website: forexroboteasy.com

// This trading robot is designed to trade in the MT5 platform using the Golden Watch algorithm.
// It includes necessary libraries and indicators, such as the Trade library for executing trades and the PeakRepainterStrict indicator for identifying market volatility.

// The robot uses global variables to set default parameters, including the stop loss, take profit, lot size, volatility range, maximum number of orders to open, and risk percentage.

// The OnTick function is the main function that gets called on each tick of the market. It first checks if the PeakRepainterStrict indicator is ready.
// If it is ready, the function proceeds to calculate the average number of transactions using historical data and adjust the volatility range based on this average.
// Next, it checks if the price is consolidating and if there are no open positions. If these conditions are met, it opens a new series of orders using the adjusted volatility range.
// Finally, it manages any manual orders that may have been placed.

// The CalculateAverageTransactions function calculates the average number of transactions using historical data. This function is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

// The AdjustVolatilityRange function adjusts the volatility range based on the average number of transactions. This function is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

// The CheckPriceConsolidation function checks if the price is consolidating. This function is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

// The OpenOrders function opens a new series of orders. It first calculates the appropriate lot size based on the risk percentage and volatility range.
// It then opens the orders using the calculated lot size.

// The NormalizeLotSize function normalizes the lot size using specific rules. This function is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

// The ManageManualOrders function manages any manual orders that may have been placed. This function is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately.

// To use this trading robot, the user should set the desired parameters in the global variables section.
